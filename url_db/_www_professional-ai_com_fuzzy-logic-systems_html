Fuzzy logic is a type of AI that enables machines to reason like humans. It is widely used in various AI applications and has many advantages. Fuzzy logic was first proposed by Lotfi Zadeh while he was working on the problem of computer understanding of natural languages. Unlike traditional logic, fuzzy logic does not categorize information into binary patterns.The Fuzzy Logic System is a computing approach that relies on the theory of fuzzy sets to map crisp inputs into crisp outputs. It is highly suitable for uncertain or approximate reasoning, and views inference as a process of propagating elastic constraints. This system helps build nonlinear functions of arbitrary complexity, and is used in areas such as neural networks, data mining, case-based reasoning, and business rules.Fuzzy logic systems are used for system identification and pattern recognition problems. They require a little amount of data to prepare a robust model, and only a limited amount of memory to complete execution. In such a case, the fuzzy system controls the temperature, based on the input parameters, like very cold, cold, warm, very warm, or hot.The main objective of Membership Functions is to map the non-fuzzy input values to fuzzy linguistic terms, vice versa. These are the widely used fuzzifiers that are known for their simplicity and lower computational requirements, yet they are not always suitable. Hence, other methods like the non-singleton fuzzy logic system are used to account for uncertainty in the data.Fuzzy logic is a type of logic that allows for approximate rather than precise reasoning. This makes it suitable for problems that don't require high accuracy but it is difficult to set exact, fuzzy rules and membership functions. Fuzzy logic is also incapable of recognizing machine learning and neural network type patterns. However, it can be enhanced with the help of deep learning, AI search algorithms, and other such technologies.
