Fuzzy logic is a type of AI that imitates human reasoning and cognition. It involves all intermediate possibilities between digital values YES and NO. Fuzzy logic can be implemented in both hardware and software.The architecture of a Fuzzy logic system consists of four main components: membership functions, rule sets, fuzzifiers, and defuzzifiers. These components work together to map input data to output results. While Fuzzy logic systems can be quite accurate, they require a lot of testing and verification to ensure that they are working correctly.This person has a lot of experience and credentials in the Microsoft Technology Stack.
