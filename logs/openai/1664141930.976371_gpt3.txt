This text describes how to build a CNN model using various tools to detect and classify traffic signals for new self-driving cars. The machine learning engineer will create a model to detect objects using a pre-trained MaskRCNN model. Credit card companies need to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions, so the goal is to build a classification model to identify them.
