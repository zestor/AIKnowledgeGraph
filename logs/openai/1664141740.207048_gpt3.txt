y-axis represents the degrees of membership in the [0, 1] interval.There can be multiple membership functions applicable to fuzzify a numerical value.Simple membership functions are used as the complex functions do not add precision in the output.Here, the input to 5-level fuzzifier varies from -10 volts to +10 volts.Hence the corresponding output also changes.Fuzzy Logic vs ProbabilityFuzzy LogicProbabilityIn fuzzy logic, we basically try to capture the essential concept of vagueness.Probability is associated with events and not facts, and those events will either occur or not occurFuzzy Logic captures the meaning of partial truthProbability theory captures partial knowledgeFuzzy logic takes truth degrees as a mathematical basisProbability is a mathematical model of ignoranceSo, these were some of the differences between fuzzy logic in AI and probability.Now, lets have a look at some of the applications of this logic.Applications of Fuzzy LogicThe Fuzzy logic is used in various fields such as automotive systems, domestic goods, environment control, etc.

summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a form of artificial intelligence that deals with imprecise or incomplete data. It is used to capture the essential concept of vagueness. Probability, on the other hand, is a mathematical model of ignorance that is associated with events and not facts. Some of the applications of fuzzy logic include automotive systems, domestic goods, and environment control.
