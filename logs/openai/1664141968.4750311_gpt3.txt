==========

Fuzzy logic is a mathematical approach to dealing with imprecise or incomplete data. It quantifies the degree of membership of an element in a set, with the membership values ranging from 0 to 1. Simple membership functions are typically used, as complex functions do not add more precision to the output. The most common type of membership function is the triangular function, but other types include trapezoidal, singleton, and Gaussian. In a 5-level fuzzy logic system, the input ranges from -10 volts to +10 volts. An example of a fuzzy logic system is an air conditioning system that adjusts the temperature by comparing the room temperature to the target temperature. To use a fuzzy logic system, one must first define the linguistic variables and terms, and then construct the membership functions. For room temperature, terms such as cold, warm, and hot can be used.
