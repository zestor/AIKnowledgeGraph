Fuzzy Logic uses inputs like speed, acceleration, momentum to decide on brakes intensity.Nissan is also using Fuzzy Logic to control the fuel injection quantity and ignition based on inputs like Engine RPM, Temperature and Load capacity.It is used in Satellites and Aircraft for Altitude control.Mitsubishi is using Fuzzy Logic to make Elevator Management more efficient by taking passenger traffic as input.Nippon Steel uses Fuzzy Logic to decide the proportion in which different cement types should be mixed to make more durable cement.Fuzzy Logic finds its application in the chemical industry for managing different processes like pH control, drying process, and distillation process.Fuzzy Logic can be combined with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to mimic how a human brain works.Fuzzy Logic aggregates data and transforms it into more meaningful information, which is used as Fuzzy sets.Fuzzy Logic Construction is very easy to read and comprehend as it closely mimics the way Human-Mind make the decision.

summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a type of artificial intelligence that uses inputs like speed, acceleration, and momentum to make decisions. Nissan is using fuzzy logic to control the fuel injection and ignition in its vehicles, and Mitsubishi is using it to manage elevator traffic more efficiently. Nippon Steel is using fuzzy logic to mix different types of cement to make a more durable product. Fuzzy logic is also being used in the chemical industry for processes like pH control, drying, and distillation. It can be combined with artificial neural networks to mimic how the human brain works.
