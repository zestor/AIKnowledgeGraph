More time went to real-world road tests that tuned the fudge factors of the control algorithms.If they succeeded, they ended up with a control algorithm of mathematical formulas involving many experimental parameters.Modifying or later optimizing such a solution is very difficult because of its lack of transparency.Fuzzy logic makes this design process faster, easier, and more transparent.It can implement control strategies using elements of everyday language.Everyone familiar with the control problem can read the fuzzy rules and understand what the system is doing and why.It also works for control systems with many control parameters.Designers can build innovative control systems that would have been intractable using traditional design techniques.Typically, fuzzy logic controls the washing process, water intake,water temperature, wash time, rinse performance, and spin speed.This optimises the life span of the washing machine.More sophisticated machines weigh the load (so you cant overload the washing machine), advise on the required amount of detergent, assess cloth material type and water hardness, and check whether the detergent is in powder or liquid form.

Fuzzy logic is a design technique that is faster, easier, and more transparent than traditional design techniques. It can implement control strategies using elements of everyday language. Typically, fuzzy logic controls the washing process, water intake, water temperature, wash time, rinse performance, and spin speed. This optimises the life span of the washing machine. More sophisticated machines weigh the load (so you cant overload the washing machine), advise on the required amount of detergent, assess cloth material type and water hardness, and check whether the detergent is in powder or liquid form.
