Given this text, Write a comprehensive summary ignoring non-relevant text:

text:
Temperature (t) = {very-cold, cold, warm, very-warm, hot} Every member of this set is a linguistic term and it can cover some portion of overall temperature values.Step 2 Construct membership functions for them The membership functions of temperature variable are as shown Step3 Construct knowledge base rules Create a matrix of room temperature values versus target temperature values that an air conditioning system is expected to provide.The operations used for OR and AND are Max and Min respectively.Combine all results of evaluation to form a final result.Step 5 Perform defuzzification Defuzzification is then performed according to membership function for output variable.Application Areas of Fuzzy Logic The key application areas of fuzzy logic are as given Automotive Systems Automatic Gearboxes Four-Wheel Steering Vehicle environment control Consumer Electronic Goods Hi-Fi Systems Photocopiers Still and Video Cameras Television Domestic Goods Microwave Ovens Refrigerators Toasters Vacuum Cleaners Washing Machines Environment Control Air Conditioners/Dryers/Heaters Humidifiers Advantages of FLSs Mathematical concepts within fuzzy reasoning are very simple.

summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a mathematical system that can be used to approximate human reasoning. In this system, variables can take on any value within a range, and each value has a corresponding membership function. This allows for more nuanced reasoning than traditional systems that only allow for two values (true or false, for example). Fuzzy logic systems have many applications, including in automotive systems, consumer electronics, and domestic appliances. They have the advantage of being relatively simple to implement and understand.
