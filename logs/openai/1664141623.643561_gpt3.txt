But a Fuzzy Logic algorithm considers all the uncertainties of a problem, where there may be possible values besides True or False.The fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence operates on the levels of possibilities of input to obtain the definite output.It can be executed in systems with different capabilities and sizes, varying from tiny microcontrollers to huge, networked, workstation-centred control systems.Furthermore, it can be executed in software, hardware, or a combination of both.In-demand Machine Learning Skills Artificial Intelligence Courses Tableau Courses  NLP Courses Deep Learning Courses The term Fuzzy Logic was first described by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965.He thought that traditional computer logic is not capable of handling unclear or vague data.Similar to humans, there are many possible values between True and False that a computer can incorporate.Boolean Logic Solution Yes (1.0) No (0) According to conventional Boolean Logic, the algorithm will take a definite input and produce a precise result Yes or No.

==========

Fuzzy logic is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with handling imprecise or unclear data, similar to how humans do it. It was first described by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965. Boolean logic is the traditional way of handling data in computers, but it can only produce precise results of either true or false, with no middle ground. Fuzzy logic allows for multiple values between true and false, making it more effective in handling uncertain data.
