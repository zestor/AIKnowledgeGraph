summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a mathematical concept that allows for the representation of uncertainty. It played an important role in the early development of artificial intelligence (AI), but its practical applications are somewhat limited. Bayesian probability is a more robust tool for dealing with uncertainty, and is now more commonly used in AI applications.
