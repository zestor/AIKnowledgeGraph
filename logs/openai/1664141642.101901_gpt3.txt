summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a system that applies rules based on input values received, in order to develop control actions. The inference engine and the knowledge base together are called a controller in a Fuzzy Logic system. Defuzzification is the inverse process of fuzzification, where fuzzy values are converted into crisp values by mapping. There are several defuzzification methods, but the best one is selected as per the input. This is a complicated process where methods, such as the maximum membership principle, weighted average method and centroid method, are used. Fuzzy logic efficiently solves complex problems by enhancing its capability to accomplish human-like decision-making and reasoning tasks. However, due to inaccuracy in results, fuzzy logic systems are not always widely accepted. A major drawback of Fuzzy Logic control systems is that they are completely dependent on human knowledge and expertise. You have to regularly update the rules of a Fuzzy Logic control system. These systems cannot recognize machine learning or neural networks. The systems require a lot of testing for validation and verification. Applications of Fuzzy Logic are spread across several fields.
