summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a type of logic that allows for approximate reasoning. It can be used to deal with uncertainty in systems, and has been used in artificial intelligence applications. There are a variety of ways to apply fuzzy logic, and it can be used for both theoretical and practical purposes.
