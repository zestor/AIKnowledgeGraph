Fuzzy logic is a continuum of values between 0 and 1.In the binary world everything below 18 would be 100% YOUNG, and everything above would be 0% YOUNG.The design of a fuzzy logic system starts with a set of membership functions for each input and a set for each output.A set of rules is then applied to the membership functions to yield a crisp output value.For this process control explanation of fuzzy logic, TEMPERATURE is the input and FAN SPEED is the output.Create a set of membership functions for each input.A membership function is simply a graphical representation of the fuzzy variable sets.For this example, use three fuzzy sets, COLD, WARM, and HOT.We will then create a membership function for each of three sets of temperature as shown in the cold-normal-hot graphic, Figure 1.Figure 1 We will use three fuzzy sets for the output, SLOW, MEDIUM, and FAST.A set of functions is created for each output set just as for the input sets.Figure 2 It should be noted that the shape of the membership functions do not need to be triangles as we have used in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a way of representing values between 0 and 1 that can be applied to various inputs and outputs in order to produce a desired output. In this example, temperature is the input and fan speed is the output. Three membership functions are created for the input (cold, warm, hot) and three are created for the output (slow, medium, fast). A set of rules is then applied to the membership functions to yield the desired output.
