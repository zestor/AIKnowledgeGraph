The Triangular Membership function is the most commonly used Membership Function. Fuzzy Logic is especially useful when you want to mimic human-like thinking in a control system. It is designed to deal with uncertainties and is proficient in finding out inferences from the conclusion. The algorithm of a Fuzzy Logic System involves defining all the variables and terms which will be acting as input to the Fuzzy System, creating a Membership Function for the System, creating a Rule-Base which will be mapped to each input, converting normal input into fuzzy input, evaluating the result from the membership function, combining all the results obtained from the Individual Ruleset, and converting the output fuzzy set into Crisp input (Defuzzification). Fuzzy Logic is being adopted across all major industries, but Automotive remains the major adopter.
