summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a type of logic that allows for approximate rather than precise reasoning. This makes it suitable for problems that don't require high accuracy but it is difficult to set exact, fuzzy rules and membership functions. Fuzzy logic is also incapable of recognizing machine learning and neural network type patterns. However, it can be enhanced with the help of deep learning, AI search algorithms, and other such technologies.
