summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a method of reasoning that provides an acceptable solution when accurate reasoning cannot be provided. It is an algorithm that takes all available data into account and makes the best possible decision according to the given input. In AI, fuzzy logic is used to regulate temperature depending on input parameters. It is also used for vague concepts such as the characteristic of tallness.
