Some machines even learn from past experience,memorising programs and adjusting them to minimise running costs.Fuzzy logic is used in a variety of control applications.If your furnace can only be on or off, for example, you might use a probabilistic function of temperature to determine when to turn it on and off, rather than having fixed high and low temperatures activate your thermostat.In some applications, that's been found to improve perceived comfort or efficiency.For more sophisticated AI applications, you could use fuzzy logic for activations in a neural net, but I don't think it's offering much improvement over fixed, weighted activations.It's possible that Samsung developers implemented some "smart" logic, but sales people decided that "fuzzy logic" sounds too cool in washing machines.If there's evidence that the implementation really uses Zadeh's fuzzy logic, I'd be happy to call it a real practical application.Browse other questions tagged ai-designapplicationsproblem-solvingfuzzy-logic.

==========

This text discusses the use of fuzzy logic in AI applications. Fuzzy logic is a probabilistic function that can be used to improve the efficiency of a process. In some cases, it has been found to improve the perceived comfort of a system. However, the author notes that it is not clear if Samsung's use of fuzzy logic in their washing machines is a real-world application of the technology.
