Usually, these developments reduce the number of fuzzy rules.Fuzzification This step converts inputs or the crisp numbers into fuzzy sets.You can measure the crisp inputs by sensors and pass them into the control system for further processing.It splits the input signal into five steps such as- Inference Engine It determines the degree of match between fuzzy input and the rules.According to the input field, it will decide the rules that are to be fired.Combining the fired rules, form the control actions.Defuzzification The Defuzzification process converts the fuzzy sets into a crisp value.There are different types of techniques available, and you need to select the best-suited one with an expert system.So, this was about the architecture of fuzzy logic in AI.Now, lets understand the membership function.Membership FunctionThe membership function is a graph that defines how each point in the input space is mapped to membership value between 0 and 1.It allows you to quantify linguistic terms and represent a fuzzy set graphically.

Fuzzy logic is a type of AI that uses fuzzy sets to represent linguistic terms and quantify them. The membership function is a graph that defines how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value between 0 and 1.
