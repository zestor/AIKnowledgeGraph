summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a type of logic that allows for approximate, rather than precise, reasoning. This can be beneficial in situations where exact reasoning is difficult or impossible, such as in machine learning. However, fuzzy logic also has its limitations, including inaccuracy and the inability to learn from failures.
