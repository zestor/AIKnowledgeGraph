In case an imbalance is detected, the spinning speed is decreased.Furthermore, balancing the washing load helps to reduce the spinning noise.Companies such as Panasonic use similar technology in their dishwashers.Fuzzy Logic is used in adjusting the cleaning cycles of dishwashers, along with the wash and rinse methods.The performance of the machine also depends upon the number of dishes put into the washer.Shift scheduling for supporting an automatic transmission.Personnel assessment in large-scale organizations.It plays a key role in the fuzzy representations performance.It portrays the fuzziness described using the fuzzy system in artificial intelligence and also depicts the amount of truth in the fuzzy logic.It is a graph that specifies how each point in the input space is plotted to membership value ranging between 0 and 1.The Membership Functions key objective is to plot the non-fuzzy input values to the fuzzy linguistic terms, and vice versa.Conclusion Although Fuzzy Logic in artificial intelligence helps to mimic human reasoning, these systems need expert guidance to be built.

summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with systems that are not precise. In other words, it allows for imprecision and uncertainty in decision-making. Fuzzy logic is used in many real-world applications, such as dishwashers, automatic transmissions, and large-scale organizations.
