Adopted and implemented across industries, it is rapidly transforming business structures and functions, with development being no exception.Moreover, this tech has given way to new theories, algorithms, logic, techniques, etc.Among these new innovations, Fuzzy Logic Systems is another crucial technique that is enabling machines to be on par with humans intelligence.Used widely, along with numerous other AI algorithms, Fuzzy Logic Systems is a vital part of various AI applications and makes systems capable of performing human-like reasoning.and discuss its areas of application, architecture, advantages, and more.But, before we jump into Fuzzy Logic Systems, understanding the concepts of Fuzzy Logic is extremely crucial, as it plays an integral part in Fuzzy Logic Systems.He came up with this theory while he was working on the problem of computer understanding of Natural Languages, which cannot be translated into absolute terms of 0 and 1.Like traditional and classical logic Fuzzy Logic does not categorize information into binary patterns (0 or 1), like Yes or No, Day or Night, True or False, etc.

summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic is a type of AI that enables machines to reason like humans. It is widely used in various AI applications and has many advantages. Fuzzy logic was first proposed by Lotfi Zadeh while he was working on the problem of computer understanding of natural languages. Unlike traditional logic, fuzzy logic does not categorize information into binary patterns.
