==========

Fuzzy logic is a many-valued logic form which may have truth values of variables in any real number between 0 and 1. It is useful in situations where it is difficult to decide whether a statement is true or false. The fuzzy logic algorithm helps to solve a problem after considering all available data and takes the best possible decision for the given input. The FL method imitates the way of decision making in a human which considers all the possibilities between digital values T and F. Some advantages of fuzzy logic systems are that they are more efficient and accurate than other logic systems and they can handle more complex problems. However, some disadvantages of fuzzy logic systems are that they can be difficult to understand and implement.
