==========

Fuzzy logic is a system that helps to deal with the uncertainty in engineering. It has four main parts: fuzzification, knowledge base, inference engine, and defuzzification. The fuzzification module transforms crisp numbers into fuzzy sets. The knowledge base stores IF-THEN rules provided by experts. The inference engine makes fuzzy inference on the inputs and IF-THEN rules. The defuzzification module transforms the fuzzy set into a crisp value.
