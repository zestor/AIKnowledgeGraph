Based on the % match, it determines which rules need implment according to the given input field.After this, the applied rules are combined to develop the control actions.There are many types of techniques available, so you need to select it which is best suited when it is used with an expert system.Fuzzy logic takes truth degrees as a mathematical basis on the model of the vagueness phenomenon.Fuzzy set Theory Classical Set Fuzzy Set Theory Classes of objects with sharp boundaries.A classical set is defined by crisp boundaries, i.e., there is clarity about the location of the set boundaries.A fuzzy set always has ambiguous boundaries, i.e., there may be uncertainty about the location of the set boundaries.Widely used in digital system design Used only in fuzzy controllers.It shows that in a Fuzzy system, the values are denoted by a 0 to 1 number.Fuzzy Logic with Example Application Areas of Fuzzy Logic The Blow given table shows application of Fuzzy logic by famous companies in their products.

==========

This text discusses the use of fuzzy logic in digital system design. Fuzzy logic is a technique that allows for imprecise or inexact data to be used in calculations. This can be useful in situations where traditional methods would fail or provide inaccurate results. The text provides several examples of companies that have used fuzzy logic in their products.
