Used widely across numerous industries for system identification, pattern recognition problems, etc., Fuzzy Logic Systems require a little amount of data to prepare a robust model.Moreover, it needs only a limited amount of memory to complete execution.In such a case, the fuzzy system controls the temperature, based on the input parameters, like very cold, cold, warm, very warm, or hot.Defining linguistics variables and terms for room temperature, cold, hot, warm, etc.Construct membership functions of temperature variables.Prepare knowledge base rule, which includes a matrix of the room temperature and the required room temperature.Obtain the fuzzy rule with the help of fuzzy set operations.Moreover, it determines the rules that are to be fired, combining the fired rules, from the control actions.As there are various methods of defuzzification, the one best suited is used with specific expert systems to reduce the error.It helps characterize the fuzziness described by the fuzzy logic as well as represents the degrees of truth in the fuzzy logic.

summary:

==========

Fuzzy logic systems are used for system identification and pattern recognition problems. They require a little amount of data to prepare a robust model, and only a limited amount of memory to complete execution. In such a case, the fuzzy system controls the temperature, based on the input parameters, like very cold, cold, warm, very warm, or hot.
