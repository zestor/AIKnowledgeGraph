summary:

==========

The architecture of a Fuzzy logic system consists of four main components: membership functions, rule sets, fuzzifiers, and defuzzifiers. These components work together to map input data to output results. While Fuzzy logic systems can be quite accurate, they require a lot of testing and verification to ensure that they are working correctly.
