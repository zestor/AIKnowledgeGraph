A Data Science Enthusiast with in-hand skills in programming languages such as Java & Python.Fuzzy refers to something which is unclear or vague.Fuzzy Logic in AI provides valuable flexibility for reasoning.This approach is similar to how humans perform decision making.And it involves all intermediate possibilities between YES and NO.The conventional logic block that a computer understands takes precise input and produces a definite output as TRUE or FALSE, which is equivalent to a human beings YES or NO.Also, it can be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of both.The recent update in the fuzzy theory provides different effective methods for the design and tuning of fuzzy controllers.
