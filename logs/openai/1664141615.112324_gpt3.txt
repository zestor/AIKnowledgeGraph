Fuzzy logic is extensively used for practical and commercial purposes. It might not give precise reasoning, but acceptable reasoning. Various assumptions are used in the sets, and the output will be precisely obtained from the corresponding assumed values. The fundamental configuration used in the fuzzy logic is if-else sets. Moreover, the precise answer will be attained from the input variations. The if-else considerations offer precise output value. In the working of fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence, the inputs are categorized into various memberships to achieve the outputs. The if-else logic assigns inputs with the function of membership. Various input variables exist when employing fuzzy logic in multi-input systems. Hence, the system output will be calculated after implementing the AND operation on the provided input variables. This logic works as a standard controller on a few platforms because it includes various parts like controller, Fuzzifier, and Defuzzifier.
