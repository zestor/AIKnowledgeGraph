summary:

==========

The Fuzzy Logic System is a computing approach that relies on the theory of fuzzy sets to map crisp inputs into crisp outputs. It is highly suitable for uncertain or approximate reasoning, and views inference as a process of propagating elastic constraints. This system helps build nonlinear functions of arbitrary complexity, and is used in areas such as neural networks, data mining, case-based reasoning, and business rules.
