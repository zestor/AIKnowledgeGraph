It uses fuzzy logic to make intelligent decisions, but customers respond in fuzziness, too.So, in order to make the system more accurate, researchers apply fuzzy science on such devices.Fuzzy logic is a way to represent logical statements using real values instead of the conventional binary values.If the data is imprecise in the system, then a human being cannot infer the knowledge or relation.It is hoped that future research will lead to solving these problems.Fuzzy control allows control based on the actual output from the process, as opposed to control based on a setpoint.This means that the output of a control loop is not fixed at a specific value, but is allowed to vary within a specific range.This gives better control than fixed-point control, especially in applications with a non-linear relationship between input and output.Prepare for a Career of the Future Apply for Master of Science in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence from LJMU Leave a comment Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

==========

Fuzzy logic is a way of representing logical statements using real values rather than binary values. This allows for more accurate decision-making by systems, as well as better control in applications with a non-linear relationship between input and output.
