The term "fuzzy" refers to something that is vague or not very clear. Fuzzy logic is a system that is applied to scenarios where it is difficult to categorize states as a binary true or false. Fuzzy logic can incorporate intermediate values like partially true and partially false. It can be implemented across a wide range of devices, from small micro-controllers to large IT systems. Fuzzy logic tries to mimic human-like decision-making, which can incorporate all values in between true and false. The rules of fuzzy logic are sets of if-then statements that decide the event occurrence based on conditions. These converted inputs are passed on to the control system for further processing. The output of the fuzzy logic system are crisp inputs. The membership function defines how input to the fuzzy system is mapped to values between 0 and 1. The input is usually termed as the universe (U), as it can contain any value.
